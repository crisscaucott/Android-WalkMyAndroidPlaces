WalkMyAndroidPlaces
=============================

This is the practical "WalkMyAndroidPlaces" from the [Advanced Android Development](https://developers.google.com/training/courses/android-advanced) which perform a reverse geocoding to adquire the current device address by pressing the "Start tracking location" button.
The app can show all the device nearest places (using [Place Picker](https://developers.google.com/places/android-api/placepicker)) to select them and adquire his address and show it in the screen.
For video purposes, the real gps location is faked using "Fake GPS Location app".
